融合爵士兴起于七十年代，是爵士乐的分支之一。只要你有足够的创新意识和胆量，任何音乐都可以成为爵士乐的调料。如今所谓的融合爵士一般是指在爵士乐的基础上融合了摇滚乐、世界音乐等成分，同时也融进一些流行音乐元素的爵士风格。因此，融合爵士给人的感觉是既新鲜又流行，而又不失爵士乐的色彩。从乐队上看，融合爵士打破了传统爵士乐队一直以原声乐器为主体的原则，它大量的使用电声乐器和电子乐器，使其更具现代气息。比如用电贝司代替原声贝司，用电子合成器代替钢琴，电吉他使用效果器（传统爵士乐一般不使用使用效果器）等做法都是一次大胆的创新。从节奏形态上看，融合爵士经常加强鼓和贝司的力度，制造出奔腾不息的节奏律动，钢琴和吉他也从原来演奏旋律声部转变为节奏乐器。这种不规则的低音线条，疯狂的贝司击弦，厚重的摇滚节拍加上爵士乐的规则，有时又被称为爵士放克（Jazz Funk）。总之，融合爵士的电气味重了，流行味浓了，因此被人接受的可能度也就大了。Jazz fusion (also known as fusion) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.Rock and RnB came from jazz in the 1940s via the jump blues genre. Needless to say, over the years jazz, rock and RnB have enjoyed a close relationship and have cross-influenced each other from the beginning. In the mid to late 60s, rock and RnB under went major changes with rock becoming much louder and more experimental under the influence of artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Cream, while RnB became more syncopated and abstract with the new funk sound created by James Brown, Bootsy Collins, Sly Stone and Larry Graham. Meanwhile, Latin jazz was undergoing similar experimental changes under the guidance of artists such as Hermato Pascoal and Flora Purim.At this point in the mid to late 60s, any intersection between jazz, rock, funk and Latin became a radically different form of music that eventually came to be called fusion.
