放克金属（Funk Metal）从重金属中赚取了重型的吉他音色和riff,并将其爆破性的贝斯线条和简化了的放克节奏融合在了一起。这种风格出现在八十年代的中期， 像Red Hot Chili Peppers 和Fishbone算是最早的代表，从他们的音乐中可以感觉到疯客的感觉明显强与重金属的影响。尽管后来的一些乐队保留了狂野的贝斯线条，但是风格逐渐更加偏向于重金属。同重金属一样，放克金属同样也是表现乐手高超演奏技巧的良好途径。Funk metal (also known as thrash funk or punk-funk) is a fusion genre of funk rock and alternative metalwhich infuses heavy metal music (often thrash metal) with elements of funk and punk rock. It was prevalent in the mainstream during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as part of the alternative metal movement. The genre has been described as a "brief but extremely media-hyped stylistic fad".
