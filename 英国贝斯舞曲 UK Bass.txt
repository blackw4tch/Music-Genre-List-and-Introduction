Also known as:  UK Bass Music, Future BassUK Bass is a loose term used for certain stylistic developments in British dance music, arising from Dubstep and UK Funky in 2009 and 2010. It includes a strong emphasis on bass and sub-bass, but tends to experiment with the structure and format, as well as variations of the bpm. Influences from other genres, such as Juke, Footwork, Techno, House, UK Garage, Contemporary R&B and Wonky, are frequently repurposed and filtered through a Dubstep and UK Funky sound. The result is a varied range of sounds that stretches or breaks the barriers for the latter genres. Labels such as Night Slugs, Numbers., Hessle Audio, and Swamp 81, as well as DJs like Ben UFO, Oneman, and Pearson Sound, have been influential in popularizing this style.
