Roots Reggae美国摇滚和Ska（牙买加流行乐）民族摇滚的杂交，其代表乃强烈的歌唱和虔诚的拉斯特法里主义歌词；这可能是Reggae音乐最容易理解的一 种形式，也是最全球性的一种。Roots reggae浮现于70年代初，并马上发展成为慢拍摇滚的追随者。 A cross between American rock and ska/rock steady, Roots Reggae is typified by strong vocals and devoutly rasta lyrics; it is perhaps the most easily accessible form of reggae, and the most successful globally. Roots reggae emerged during the early 1970s, immediately following the development of rocksteady.
