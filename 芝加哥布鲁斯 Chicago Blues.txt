芝加哥布鲁斯（Chicago Blues）反映了布鲁斯音乐在美国芝加哥的发展。从现在来看，它是天时地利人和的结果。尽管传统的布鲁斯于1920年代源于密西西比三角洲,然而由于经济大萧条，一些南方的黑人来到北方一些都市打工。在包容的芝加哥，很多黑人开始参与一些现场演出，将这种南方的原汁原味的乡土气息的音乐带入了快节奏的都市中。在保留了传统之外，一些音乐人在也芝加哥开始了对布鲁斯音乐更广阔的探索，以于都市气息更好的吻合。特征Chicago Blues从名字来看有着强烈的地域性。广义来看，它包含了所有在芝加哥发展的布鲁斯音乐。然而用得更多的是它狭义的定义。在1947年，为了帮一部电影配原声，Muddy Waters在传统布鲁斯的原声器乐内加入电声放大器，并引入了副吉他手、口琴手、鼓手、贝斯手等组成了一个小型乐团，以匹配芝加哥喧闹的城市气息。流行时段1950年代左右发源英文简介What is now referred to as the classic Chicago Blues style was developed in the late '40s and early '50s, taking Delta blues, fully amplifying it and putting it into a small-band context. Adding drums, bass, and piano (sometimes saxophones) to the basic string band and harmonica aggregation, the style created the now standard blues band lineup. The form was (and is) flexible to accommodate singers, guitarists, pianists, and harmonica players as the featured performer in front of the standard instrumentation. Later permutations of the style took place in the late '50s and early '60s, with new blood taking their cue from the lead guitar work of B.B. King and T-Bone Walker, creating the popular west side subgenre (which usually featured a horn section appended to the basic rhythm section). Although the form has also embraced rock beats, it has generally stayed within the guidelines developed in the 1950s and early '60s. (By Allmusic)
