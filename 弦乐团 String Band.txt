现今经常被提到的弦乐一般是指西洋管弦乐队中的弦乐组（小提琴，中提琴，大提琴，低音提琴）。可以合奏的乐器很多，在西洋弦乐方面最常见的是弦乐四重奏（第一小提，第二小提琴，中提琴，大提琴）不过形式也不固定。现在的重奏形式更始层出不穷，木管组（长笛，单簧管，双簧管，巴松）也经常加上圆号组成五重奏。民族器乐中除了传统常见的重奏形式，古筝，琵琶，二胡等都可以加上钢琴来伴奏。With their intricate instrumental interplay and driving rhythms, String Bands were the most distinctive subgenre of old time country. Though all old-time artists supported themselves with stringed instruments, string bands were notable because they emphasized the instrumentation, not the singers. The popularity of string bands faded in the '30s after Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family became country's first stars, yet the groups provided the foundation for the harder sounds of bluegrass in the late '40s.
