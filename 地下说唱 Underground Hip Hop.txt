当说唱进入地下领域，这个音乐种类自身的进化和逐渐被主流的接受，为那些曾明目张胆反商业或者非常以特立独行自傲的艺术家打开了一扇门。地下说唱并没有特别严苛的定义，它可以是质朴而生猛的，或者非常激进，或者用很低的制作资金来竞争主流说唱。While rap began in the underground, the genre's evolution and gradual mainstream acceptance opened the door for artists who were brazenly anti-commercial and/or proudly independent, indifferent to the exposure promised by major-label promotion and distribution. Underground Rap has no sonic signifiers. It can be raw and unvarnished (hardcore lyrics over stripped-down beats), left-of-center to an extent that it has no potential to cross over, or emulate mainstream rap production on a low budget. It is an umbrella term that groups weirdoes like Ultramagnetic MC's, firebrands like Paris and the Coup, and gangsta rap entrepreneurs who sell mixtapes out of the trunks of their cars.
