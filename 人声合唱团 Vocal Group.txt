人声合唱团根基于预录时代的游吟曲风和前理发店派四重奏的一种风格，证明从20世纪20年代和50年代成为一种兼具流行性和艺术感的艺术风格。此风格在二战期间因为安德鲁斯姐妹的巨大成功而盛行。A style with deep roots in the pre-recorded era of minstrelsy and barber-shop quartets, Harmony Vocal Group proved a popular, artistic style of music from the 1920s well into the '50s. Excellent close-harmony units like the Mills Brothers and the Boswell Sisters started the craze in the early '30s, though with regards to popularity, vocal groups really took off during World War II with the overwhelming success of the Andrews Sisters. During the early '50s, hundreds of harmony vocal groups recorded, paced by hit-makers like the McGuire Sisters, the Ames Brothers, the Four Lads, and the Hi-Lo's. The rise of rock & roll obviously curtailed the movement, though nostalgia seekers certainly had many shows and recordings to choose from during the 1960s and '70s.
