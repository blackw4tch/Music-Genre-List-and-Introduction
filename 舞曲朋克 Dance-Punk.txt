Dance-punk也就是Disco-punk，产生于70年代后期，是一种将朋克、后朋精神及放克的律动性和早期迪斯科相融合的音乐风格。以纽约朋克运动为开端，更与70年代后期的无浪潮运动息息相连。代表艺术家有ESG，Lizzy Mercier Descloux，Liquid Liquid。到了21世纪，类似LCD Soundsystem、The Rapture这样的乐队将Dance-punk带入了公众的视野，这也直接引发了new rave（新锐舞）潮流，21世纪10年代中后期，英伦大地上涌现了一大批这样的乐队。Dance-punk was born in the late 1970s. The genre mixed the energy of Punk Rock and Post-Punk's experimentalism with the danceable rhythms of Funk and early Disco. It was mainly prominent in New York City's punk music movement and had close associations with the late 1970s No Wave scene. Key artists included ESG, Lizzy Mercier Descloux and Liquid Liquid. In the 2000s, bands such as Death From Above 1979, LCD Soundsystem and The Rapture brought the genre much more into the public eye. This led to the 'new rave' scene, which gained huge popularity in the mid to late 2000s in the UK. Spearheaded by the UK's Klaxons, Test Icicles and NYPC, the scene mixed dance-punk with Indie Rock influences.
