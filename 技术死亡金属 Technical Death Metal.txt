The music is normally extremely fast-paced and the representative bands remain firmly rooted in death metal due to their unbending devotion to rhythmic heaviness and conceptual darkness. However, when compared to death metal and its other sub-genres, aside from the features mentioned above, technical death metal bands usually give a different feeling to the music by frequently using more exotic scales. The bass lines are usually complex and the drums are extremely fast-paced with abundant use of blast-beats and other extreme drumming techniques.Some of the most known representative bands nowadays include Necrophagist, Nile, Decapitated, Cryptopsy, Origin, Spawn of Possession, Obscura and The Faceless.
