协奏曲（concerto），指一件或数件独奏乐器和乐队协同演奏，既有对比又相互交融的作品。用一件乐器者又称“独奏协奏曲”，用几件乐器者又称“大协奏曲”。通常为三个乐章，但也有仅一个乐章的协奏曲，舒曼将自己这样的作品称为“小协奏曲”，以及乐章更多的协奏曲。The first concertos -- works typically for one or more soloists and orchestra -- date from the late 17th century, and new ones are being written every year. The genre gives a talented soloist the chance to strut his or her stuff. Yet it also seems to embody the relationship between the individual and the crowd. Several beloved concertos originated in the late Baroque era, including Vivaldi's violin concertos entitled the "Four Seasons," and Bach's "Brandenburg Concertos," which represent the concerto grosso form -- a group of soloists accompanied by an orchestra. The touring virtuoso tradition of concerto performance began with Mozart and Beethoven, flourished in the 19th century when composers such as Liszt and Tchaikovsky were happy to push soloists to their technical limits, and continues even now. Concertos will be written as long as the idea of the one against the many remains relevant.
