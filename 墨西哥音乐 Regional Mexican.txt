Regional Mexican is a radio format for music radio, typically defined to include Banda, Ranchera, Mariachi, Tejano, Grupero and Norteña. It is the most popular radio format targeting Hispanic Americans in the United States.The large number of immigrants from Northern Mexico can lead to an emphasis upon Norteña on Regional Mexican radio stations, though markets with larger Hispanic audiences can have multiple Regional Mexican stations, with variations in which region from which the music is taken.
