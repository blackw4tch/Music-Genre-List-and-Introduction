新浪漫是新浪潮里一支特别的流派，歌手通常浓妆艳抹，穿着华丽。 新浪漫除了象David Bowie 和Roxy Music 那样以视觉线索吸引人，还有他们的旋律。从Low-era Bowie 到 latter-day Roxy Music，新浪漫创作了一种圆滑的，合成的，适合于跳舞的流行音乐，这种音乐很时髦然而却十分短暂。与其它任何后朋流派相比，新浪漫更华丽并依赖于时尚。Duran Duran 是新浪漫里最后一支乐队，也是唯一一支成为巨星的乐队。 新浪漫音乐逐渐消失于1984年，但在90年代中期由Melody Maker-sponsored领导的 non-movement Romo.曾有过一段短暂的复兴。New Romanticism (also called blitz kids and a variety of other names) was a pop culture movement in the United Kingdom that began around 1979 and peaked around 1981. Developing in London nightclubs such as Billy's and The Blitz and spreading to other major cities in the UK, it was based around flamboyant, eccentric fashion and New Wave music. Several music acts from the era adopted the style of the movement and became known to epitomise it within the music and mainstream press, including Ultravox, Visage, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, ABC and Boy George (of Culture Club). Japan and Adam and the Ants were also labelled as New Romantic artists by the press, although they had no direct connection to the original scene. A number of these bands adopted synthesizers and helped to develop synthpop in the early 1980s, which, combined with the distinctive New Romantic visuals, helped them first to national success in the UK and, with help of MTV to play a major part in the Second British Invasion of the U.S. charts. By the mid-1980s, the original movement had largely dissipated and, although some of the artists associated with the scene continued their careers, they had largely abandoned the aesthetics of the movement and the synthpop sound. There were attempts to revive the movement from the 1990s, including the short-lived romo movement.
