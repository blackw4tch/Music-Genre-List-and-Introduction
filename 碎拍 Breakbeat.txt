Breakbeat（也称Broken Beats）是对80年代后期的House（库房）加以采样和编排，将原先House的那种有规则的“咚咚咚”的鼓点声加以破碎化手法表现出来，并加以Sampling（采样）、Breaks（暂停）、Cuts（间断）等手法修饰。而Break Beat则是此类的一个总称，之下以特征更分Big Beat，Nu Breaks，Drum’n’Bass，Brit Hop等等，在此介绍Breaks的范畴，也就是以Nu Breaks/Big Beat为主，BPM略低的一类，而Drum’n’Bass因形成一定气候，几乎脱离Broken Beat的范畴，成为一种新的单独类型More a scene centered in West London than an easily fenced-in sound, broken beat looks as far back to '70s Jazz-Funk and Dub Reggae while also containing germs from '80s and '90s movements like house, techno, drum'n'bass, and contemporary R&B. Unlike the polite tendencies of acid jazz -- a movement of the '80s and '90s that also blended several styles -- broken beat takes its inspirations as mere launching points and often utilizes frenetic, syncopated beat structures that sound sputtery and stuttered more often than they sound straightforward. Vocalists, predominantly female, feature in many of the tracks, all of which are bold, bright, and -- for the most part -- full of rhythmic tension. Keyboards are another major factor, often taking cues from the likes of George Duke andHerbie Hancock. Immediately after its late-'90s germination, broken beat underwent a fast growth throughout West London. Several labels (2000 Black, Bitasweet, People, Co-Op, Laws of Motion, Main Squeeze) were started by producers -- producers who often worked under several aliases. The fact that the scene was heavily reliant upon collaborations made the style's family tree all the more difficult to diagram. Outposts have since developed in several other countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.
