就像这种音乐名字所启示的那样，噪音是泥泞的，生硬粗暴的，使人精疲力竭的。它为了开拓声波的攻击性，几乎完全摈弃了旋律和作曲技巧。从来自日本的Merzbow震耳欲聋，牙齿霍霍的攻击，到Amphetamine Reptile厂牌下乐队Tar 和Vertigo厚重，碾压式的紧张感，这是一种黑暗和残忍的音乐，将摇滚乐推向最远的极致。到了90年代末，50年代具象音乐中开创的正弦波死灰复燃，大批音乐家采用这种元素进行创作，比如大友良英。Sludgy, abrasive, and punishing, Noise is everything its name promises, expanding on the music's capacity for sonic assault while almost entirely rejecting the role of melody and songcraft. From the ear-splitting, teeth-rattling attack of Japan's Merzbow to the thick, grinding intensity of Amphetamine Reptile-label bands like Tar and Vertigo, it's dark, brutal music that pushes rock to its furthest extremes. By the end of the '90s, a resurgence in the use of sine waves -- originally explored by musique concrète artists in the '50s -- became increasingly frequent among noise artists such as Otomo Yoshihide.
