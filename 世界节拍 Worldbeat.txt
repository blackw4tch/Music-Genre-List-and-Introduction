Worldbeat is a music genre that blends Western pop music or rock music with traditional, folk or world music influences. Worldbeat is similar to other cross pollination labels of contemporary and roots genres, and which suggest a rhythmic, harmonic or textural contrast between its modern and ethnic elements.
