Celtic New Age is a hybrid of Celtic themes, instrumentation, and songs, plus new age production and sensibilities. Clannad and Enyaare the best-known figures of this genre, but they're hardly the only artists that specialize in this fusion. This dreamy, ethereal sound crossed over into the mainstream in the late '80s with Enya's Watermark album, and continued to thrive throughout the '90s.
