流行音乐中器乐作品的特点是：节奏鲜明，轻松活泼或抒情优美，演奏方法多种多样，音响多变，色彩丰富，织体层次简明，乐队规模不大，现代作品多使用电声乐器。声乐作品的特点是：生活气息浓郁、抒情、风趣、音域不宽，手法通俗、曲调顺口、易于传唱；歌词多用生活语言，浅显易，易为听者接受和传唱；歌手多是自成一格的流行歌星，发声方法各有千秋，不受声乐学派的约束，演唱时感情重于声音技巧，动和自由不羁，自然亲切，易引起听众的共鸣；小乐队的强声伴奏与歌声融为一体。由于流行音乐具备上述特点，所以就能够和群众连在一起，无论文化水平的高低，都易于接受。Instrumental Pop is purely an easy listening style, not to be confused with instrumental pop/rock, instrumental R&B, or jazz-pop. It is most often performed by orchestras, which may feature symphonic or big-band-jazz instrumentation, but it may cover anything from small brass ensembles to -- in the case of instrumental pop stalwart Lawrence Welk -- polka groups. Many instrumental pop recordings draw upon an already existing repertoire of traditional pop standards, as well as jazz and rock songs that can be adapted to fit the easy listening style; this approach emphasizes the skills of the conductor and arranger, since the audience will likely be familiar with the melodies. There are many exceptions, however, one of the most immediately identifiable being the recordings of skilled composers like Henry Mancini and Bert Kaempfert, who introduced their own standards into the pop canon. Instrumental pop is sometimes geared to be romantic, sometimes carefree and upbeat, but above all, it's light, soothing, comfortable music.
