Neo-Medieval Folk (aka Medieval Folk) is meant to emulate European Folk Music from the Middle Ages. The genre emerged in 1980s in Germany from the Neo-Medieval movement and is characterised by the use of traditional instruments, such as bagpipe, hurdy gurdy, flute, nyckelharpa, tambourine, davul, goblet drum, shawm, bombard, cittern, tromba marina, timpani and lute. Songs are usually cheerful and energetic, but there are also more peaceful and solemn tunes. Artists frequently use medieval works, such as Carmina Burana, in their lyrics. The lyrical themes are not limited to Middle Ages though, as many bands also take inspiration from other periods. Key examples of the genre include Faun, Corvus Corax and The Moon and the Nightspirit, among others.
