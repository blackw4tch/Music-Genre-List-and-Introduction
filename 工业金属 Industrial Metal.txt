工业金属是工业音乐中的工业摇滚所衍生出的曲风，是重金属的其中一个分支。此乐风最主要的乐器搭配和团员配置通常是是主唱、电吉他、贝斯、爵士鼓，当然也会搭配一些电子的元素，所以会有些MIDI音效的搭配如音序器（sequencers）、取样器或合成器等。Industrial metal is a musical genre that draws from industrial dance music, thrash metal and hardcore punk, using repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals. Founding industrial metal acts include Ministry, Godflesh, and KMFDM.Industrial metal's popularity led to some criticism from other artists associated with the industrial scene. Subsequently, it is most well known in various European permutations. Industrial metal groups have produced many acclaimed music videos.
