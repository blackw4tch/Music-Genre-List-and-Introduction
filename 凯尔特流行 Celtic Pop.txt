凯尔特流行（Celtic Pop）相对于传统的凯尔特音乐有很多的相似之处，美国和英国的乡村流行就利用这点来模仿---虽然悦耳的音调或是乐器在跟随流行习俗并且很少误解传统形式的音乐核心上明显的被可信的文章影响。这种风格在很大程度上开发于80年代，沿袭了在70年代复苏的传统爱尔兰民谣，这些民谣随着时间的流逝，最初创立的坚定玩民谣的表演者开始在其曲风中混合了摇滚和流行的元素（尽管顶级的摇滚乐手像the Pogues并没有适应这种类型）。当新浪潮乐迷开始在一些死板的凯尔特音乐中发掘缥缈的元素，一些凯尔特流行也开始适应这种变化，除了标准基于声学的乐器外还融入了电子合成器（但不是和凯尔特溶解的风格很相似）。Capercaillie 和Clannad是玩这种风格中最重要的两支乐队。 　Celtic Pop usually compares to traditional Celtic music in much the same way American and British folk-pop draws upon its counterparts -- while the melodies (and perhaps instrumentation) are unmistakably influenced by the authentic article, at its core the music follows pop conventions and would rarely be mistaken for the traditional form. The style largely developed in the '80s, following a revival of traditional Irish folk during the '70s which, over time, found performers with strong folk roots gradually beginning to mix elements of rock and pop into their original compositions (although predominantly rock artists like the Pogues don't fit the description). As new age music fans began to discover the ethereal, haunting properties of certain strains of Celtic music, some Celtic pop grew to encompass those tendencies as well, incorporating synthesizers in addition to standard acoustic-based instrumentation (but not quite to the same degree as Celtic fusion artists). Capercaillie and Clannad were two of the most important bands performing in the style.
