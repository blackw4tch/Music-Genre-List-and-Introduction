Nu-disco or nu-house is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with a renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco, early to mid-1980s italo disco and boogie, and the synthesizer-heavy Euro disco and P-Funk aesthetics.The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport. These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro and other genres popular in the late ′70s and early ′80s. It is also used by Beatport, to describe the music on several American labels that were previously associated with the genres electroclash and french house.In 2002, The Independent described nu-disco as the result of applying "modern technology and pin-sharp production" to ′70s disco and funk. In 2008, Beatport described nu-disco as "everything that springs from the late 1970s and early 1980s (electronic) disco, boogie, cosmic, Balearic and Italo disco continuum," while Spin magazine placed an umlaut over the "u" in "nu", used the term interchangeably with Eurodisco, and cited strong Italo disco as well as electroclash influences.Nu-disco is most popular in Europe and Australia. Bands such as Miami Horror, Cut Copy, Cadillac and Bag Raiders epitomize the Australian nu-disco sound. The French disco-revival sound can be seen in big acts such as Daft Punk, Stardust, Modjo, Madeon, Breakbot, Justice, Chromeo, as well as Duck Sauce, Armand Van Helden's collaborative project with A-Trak. While the latter may qualify more as an electro band, their walking bass lines and funk rhythms (as seen especially in "I Want Your Soul") are reminiscent of the genre.
