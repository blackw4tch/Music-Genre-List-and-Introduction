乡村音乐（Country music），也称乡村与西部（Country and Western），是一种当代的流行音乐，起源于美国南部与阿帕拉契山区。乡村音乐的根源可追溯至1920年代，融合了传统民谣音乐、凯尔特音乐、福音音乐及古时音乐。1940年代，当乡土音乐（hillbilly music）地位渐衰时，人们开始以统一的术语“乡村音乐”作为称呼，1970年代更大大普及，并在世界各地（除了美国及爱尔兰）取代了“乡村与西部”的称呼。Country music is a genre of American popular music that originated in the rural regions of the Southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles, and harmonicas.The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.
