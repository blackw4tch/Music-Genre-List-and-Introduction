游戏被称为第九种艺术，是各项艺术的完美集合体。游戏是一个独立的、完整的世界。这个缔造的世界里面，音乐是不可或缺的因素。游戏的玩家在探索着未知的游戏世界时，在一张张完全不同的游戏地图里面徘徊探索，完全融入了那个世界里面。音乐有着不可或却的作用。在九十年代之前，游戏音乐是由Trent Reznor、Fluke这样的音乐家创作的，他们正视舞曲、电子乐及摇滚。而且，早期的游戏音乐中暗示出的重复、如催眠一般的节奏被证明奠定了现代舞曲的根基。Video Game Music refers to the tinny, electronic music that is played in the background during video games. At first, video game music was cheaply-produced, naggingly catchy computer music, but as the systems became more sophisticated, so did the music. By the mid-'90s, video game music was being composed by such musicians as Trent Reznor and Fluke, two artists who had come to grips with electronic music, dance, and rock. And, in a weird way, it demonstrated that the early days of video game music suggested the repetitive, hypnotic electronic rhythms that became the foundation of modern dance and techno.
