乡村布吉音乐是乡村酒吧轻键盘乐与纳什维尔之声的交融。它具有欢快的旋律与蓝调的变奏，并由乡村乐器伴奏。从根本上来说，乡村布吉音乐用其快节奏的曲调与蓝调和声为日后的摇滚打下了基础。Country Boogie is a cross between the bluesy inflections of honky tonk and the polished style of the Nashville sound. It has a rollicking beat and follows bluesy changes, but is played with country instruments. In essence, the genre foreshadowed rockabilly with its uptempo beat and bluesy chords.
