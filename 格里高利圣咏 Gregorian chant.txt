格里高利圣咏(英语：Gregorian chant)，是西方单声圣歌的主要传统，是一种单声部、无伴奏的罗马天主教宗教音乐。格里高利圣咏主要是在第9世纪和第10世纪，法兰克人到达西欧和中欧期间发展起来，后来继续有所增加和编写。通常人们认为是教宗额我略一世发明了格里高利圣咏，但学者们认为是在后来的加洛林王朝时期，综合了罗马圣咏和高卢圣咏而形成。格里高利圣咏共有8种调式。传统上，格里高利圣咏由男人或男孩组成的唱诗班在教堂中演唱。Gregorian chant is the central tradition of Western plainchant, a form of monophonic, unaccompanied sacred song of the western Roman Catholic Church.Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries, with later additions and redactions. Although popular legend credits Pope St. Gregory the Great with inventing Gregorian chant, scholars believe that it arose from a later Carolingian synthesis of Roman chant and Gallican chant.Gregorian chant was traditionally sung by choirs of men and boys in churches, or by women and men of religious orders in their chapels. It is the music of the Roman Rite, performed in the Mass and the monastic Office. Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, Ambrosian chant still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the Mozarabic chant of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship. During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence.
