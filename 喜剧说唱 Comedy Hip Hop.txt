While many examples of comedy hip hop could be considered a parody of the hip hop genre, in the case of artists who merely incorporate humor into their more serious, purist hip hop styles, such as Eminem, this is not necessarily the case.Before the darker themes that are characteristic of the Gangsta rap of the 1990s, comedy hip hop, with its lighter and more humorous style, came to prominence in the 1980s,[1] carried by popular acts such as the Beastie Boys. Various influential comedy hip hop groups began in the early 1990s, such as Das EFX and Fu-Schnickens, and throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, rappers like Eamon, Hopsin, Eminem, Jon Lajoie, and The Lonely Island gained popularity. Eamon is known for his 2004 hit, "I Love Them Ho's" in 2004. Rucka Rucka Ali is also an artist who experiments with comedy hip hop while touching on social issues like racism, as in his song, "I Can Do Whatever I'm White". "Weird Al" Yankovic has made entries to this music genre, along with Nerdcore. "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is also a well known song of comedy hip hop. While few rappers make comedy hip hop their focus, the genre maintains a substantial loyal following.
