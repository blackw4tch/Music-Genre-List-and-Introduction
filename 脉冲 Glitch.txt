Glitch字面上是指电脑或硬件设备出的小毛病，它是电子音乐的一种实验手法，主要是用一些数字器械故障所发出的声音作为录音来源，比如仪器爆破声、软件故障扭曲声、CD跳碟声、硬件噪声等等都是Glith音乐人常常喜好的。90年代初，Oval等音乐人尝试用此种声效与氛围乐结合，带动了其发展。特征Glitch不论是从音色还是编曲手法来说都是一种创新，它反映了当前科技时代的无所不能，遵循的是“变废为宝”的理念。广义上被置之不理的音色噪音产生了出其不意的效果。和单纯的噪音音乐天壤之别，Glitch取于噪音但没有躁动，它更阴柔温暖，富于灵性。流行时段：90年代初至今英文简介Glitch is a style of experimental Electronic music that uses the sounds created by malfunctioning digital technology - bugs, crashes, system errors, hardware noise, CD skipping, and digital distortion - as main technique of composition. This unusual method of musical creation arguably began in Germany in the early 90s, with artists like Oval combining the technique with Ambient music to help cement its place in modern electronic music history. At the other end of the Glitch spectrum, Japanese musician Yasunao Tone's use of damaged CDs created dense, extreme walls of sound, with Solo for Wounded CD perhaps being the best example. Modern glitch tends to use software to recreate these sounds, as opposed to genuinely defecting technology, and this increased ease of creation has resulted in the genre spreading out into other areas, such as Glitch Pop and Glitch Hop.
