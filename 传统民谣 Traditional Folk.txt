传统民谣融合十九世纪初期美国东部乡村地区的爱尔兰及苏格兰移民的民谣、德州弦乐曲及江湖走唱卖药歌而成，曲调轻松诙谐，好听悦耳，和缓温暖，大多以叙事及抒发感情为主，主要乐器是民谣吉他及斑鸠琴琴有时会佐以曼陀林、手风琴、小提琴、口琴极简单手鼓调味，洋溢着浓浓乡村香草味及校园民歌自弹自唱风情。Traditional Folk refers to the folk songs of the first half of the 20th century, before folk became the province of personal singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan. Traditional folk tends to be written as universal truths, and often concerns big issues instead of private matters.
