蓝草音乐（Bluegrass）是美国民谣音乐的一种，同时也是乡村音乐的分支。它在爱尔兰、苏格兰、英格兰的传统音乐分别有不同的来源。蓝草音乐的灵感来自于英国与爱尔兰、尤其是苏格兰阿巴拉契亚的新移民，和爵士乐与蓝调一样。相对于传统音乐里，所有乐器同时演奏，或某项乐器做主角、其他乐器负责配乐的演奏模式，在蓝草音乐里，就像爵士乐，每项乐器都有机会独奏，或是在其他乐器的伴奏下即兴演奏。典型的传统蓝草音乐，是以弦乐器为基础，像是曼陀林、空心吉他、班卓琴、小提琴、直立式贝斯等，也可以再配上歌声。Bluegrass music grew out of traditional string band music that formed the roots of country music. In the '40s, country music began to splinter into different directions, as honky tonk and country-pop became genres of their own. A certain segment of country musicians continued playing traditional string music. Led by Bill Monroe, these musicians adhered to the songs, structures, and conventions of string bands, but they made the music faster, harder, and more technically demanding. The result was bluegrass; the genre was named after Bill Monroe's backing band, the Blue Grass Boys. After its inception in the mid-'40s, bluegrass didn't change for nearly 20 years. In the late '60s, a number of bluegrass groups began expanding the possibilities of the genre, much to the chagrin of many of the music's most popular artists and dedicated fans. Consequently, the new breed of bluegrass groups were dubbed progressive bluegrass while those that adhered to the music's heritage were tagged Traditional Bluegrass. Over the next three decades, progressive bluegrass changed frequently, while the sound of traditional bluegrass never varied.
