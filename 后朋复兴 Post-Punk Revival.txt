后朋复兴(Post-Punk Revival)主要指90年代末，2000年后，一些独立乐队吸取一些Post-Punk老乐队的美学机理而旋起的复兴风潮，相对于老乐队，这一批新乐队取得了更好的商业成绩。The post-punk revival (also described as new wave revival, garage rock revival, or new rock revolution) was a development in alternative rock of the late 20th and early 21st centuries in which bands took inspiration from the original sounds and aesthetics of garage rock of the 1960s and post-punk and new wave of the late 1970s. Bands that broke through to the mainstream from local scenes across the world in the early 2000s included The Strokes, Interpol, The White Stripes, The Hives and The Vines, who were followed to commercial success by many existing and new acts. By the end of the decade, most of the bands had broken up, moved on to other projects or were on hiatus, although some bands returned to recording and touring in the 2010s.
