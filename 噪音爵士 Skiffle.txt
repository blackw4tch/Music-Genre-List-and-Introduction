噪音爵士乐（Skiffle）又称民谣爵士乐，是一种流行音乐，受到爵士乐、蓝调、民间音乐、美国民间音乐的影响，通常是一个小乐团，早期表演者经常使用自制或临时拼凑的乐器，比较著重于即兴演出。噪音爵士乐这个词起源于美国20世纪初期，在50年代英国开始流行，主要音乐家有Lonnie Donegan，The Vipers Skiffle Group，Ken Colyer和Chas McDevitt等。噪音爵士乐后来在许多杰出的爵士乐，流行乐，蓝调，民谣和摇滚音乐家的职业生涯中起到了重要作用，并被视为是英国民间复兴，英国蓝调热潮和英国入侵美国流行音乐界第二个关键的垫脚石。Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using a combination of manufactured and homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene.
