Jungle承袭了Hardcore的精神，听起来很〝硬〞，其碎拍更是迷人，也常出现一些Rap，使Jungle有很重的黑人味（其实早期许多Jungle乐手都是黑人）。基本上，要做出又快又复杂的节拍任何人都会，但如何在复杂且快速的节奏中，让听众了解〝你到底在做什么〞，就不是件容易事了。 一些Jungle先锋如Goldie等人，其对于节拍建构的功力真是一等一。 　　 　　相较于Jungle，约95年左右出现的Drum''n''Bass，则结合了Jazz乐风，柔和了许多。顾名思义，Drum''n''Bass就是著重于鼓声和低音的表现。鼓声可能全部采用电子合成，也可能取样自真实鼓声。而它的Bass声则是显得格外巨大，有时声音还会扩散开来。但Drum''n''Bass音乐也可能清一色使用鼓声，然后将大鼓的声音用效果器〝压扁〞成Bass声。这类低音相当有压迫感，有点撞击的感觉，耳朵很容易听出来。但也有乐团有时使用真实的低音大提琴负责低音部份，如英国的4 Hero乐团。 　　虽说Drum''n''Bass有如Jungle的改良，但它俩其实界线不是非常明确。若是你听到曲子的节拍又快又复杂，或是很难抓它的节奏感，那可能就是Jungle/Drum''n''Bass了。Based almost entirely in England, Jungle (also known as drum'n'bass) is a permutation of hardcore techno that emerged in the early '90s. Jungle is the most rhythmically complex of all forms of techno, relying on extremely fast polyrhythms and breakbeats. Usually, it's entirely instrumental -- it is among the hardest of all hardcore techno, often consisting of nothing but fast drum machines and deep bass. As its name implies, jungle does have more overt reggae, dub, and R&B influences than most hardcore -- and that is why some critics claimed that the music was the sound of black techno musicians and DJs reclaiming it from the white musicians and DJs who dominated the hardcore scene. Like most techno genres, jungle is primarily a singles genre designed for a small, dedicated audience, although the crossover successes of Goldie (with his 1995 debut Timeless) and Roni Size (with the Mercury Award-winning New Forms) suggested a broader appeal and more musical possibilities than other forms of techno. Dozens of respected artists followed in their wake, fusing breakbeat with influences lifted from jazz, film music, ambient, and trip-hop.
