Boom Bap是80年代末到90年代中期的old school style beat，Boom Bap是忠于Hiphop最原始的存在。“The Boom”意味着敲击鼓点，而“Bap”意味着敲击外沿。In hip-hop music, boom bap is a style of record production. "Boom bap" is an onomatopoeia for the drum sounds prominent in boom bap. The term was popularized by the album Return of the Boom Bap.It is associated with producers from New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as DJ Premier, Pete Rock, KRS-One, Ali Shaheed Muhammed, EPMD, Marley Marl, Large Professor, Prince Paul and Scott La Rock. However, it spread far and wide. For example, boom bap is made by People Under the Stairs in Los Angeles and Recordkingz in London. Although it is still made, boom bap is no longer the dominant style of hip-hop production, remaining somewhat prominent in alternative hip hop but rarely appearing in Top 40 hip hop singles. In March 2013, Busta Rhymes claimed his next album would bring the Boom Bap back to hip hop.
