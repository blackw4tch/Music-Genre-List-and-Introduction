调式爵士（Modal jazz）是爵士乐的一种，在和声架构方面采用调式而非进行式和弦。调式爵士乐发源于20世纪50年代末和60年代，最典型的代表是迈尔士·戴维斯的专辑《Milstones》（1958）、专辑《Kind of Blue》（1959）和1960至1964年约翰·柯川的古典四人组。其他重要的表演者包括比尔·艾文斯、贺比·汉考克、Wayne Shorter和McCoy Tyner。该名称原先源于在独奏时使用调式的不同音高，但此种音乐形式的作品或伴奏还可以有如下特点：缓慢的和声节奏，一个和弦可以长达四至十六甚至更多个小节；持续低音和反复；没有或较少有全音阶功能性的进行式和弦；四度音程的和声或旋律。Modal jazz is jazz that uses musical modes rather than chord progressions as a harmonic framework. Though earlier precedents exist, modal jazz was crystallized as a distinct theory by composer George Russell in his 1953 book Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization.Particularly popular in the 1950s and 1960s, modal jazz is epitomized by Miles Davis's 1958 composition "Milestones", 1959 album Kind of Blue, and John Coltrane's classic quartet from 1960–64,both of which were directly inspired by Russell.Other important performers include Woody Shaw, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, McCoy Tyner, Larry Young, Pharoah Sanders, Joe Henderson, Chick Corea and Bobby Hutcherson.Though the term comes from the use of the pitches of particular modes (or scales) in the creation of solos, modal jazz compositions or accompaniments may only or additionally make use of the following techniquesslow-moving harmonic rhythm, where single chords may last four to sixteen or more measurespedal points and dronesabsent or suppressed standard functional chord progressionsquartal harmonies or melodiespolytonality
