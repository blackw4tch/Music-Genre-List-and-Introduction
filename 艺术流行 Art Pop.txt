艺术流行将流行音乐的旋律与非传统的音乐架构或者实验元素结合起来，是一种比较折衷的手法。Art pop is a genre that blends the melodies of Pop music with unconventional or experimental elements such as the use of progressive structures, unusual time signatures, abrupt tempo changes, vocal experimentation (like the search of extremely high-pitched tones, elongation of vocals, or the use of vocal techniques like Throat Singing), a symphonic, orchestral and theatrical performance, or the frequent addition of diverse Electronic elements like Trip Hop or Glitch. Important artists of the genre are Björk and Kate Bush.
