无伴奏合唱(义大利语：a cappella；中文音译：阿卡贝拉)是一种无伴奏的音乐形式，仅由人声来哼唱出旋律与节奏，有别于文艺复兴时期的交响乐以及巴洛克时期的协奏风格，层次感极强，常见的音乐风格為15和16世纪的教堂音乐，亦有无伴奏乐团利用这种形式来重新编排流行音乐。在外国比较著名的无伴奏团体有国王合唱团、史温格歌手、Take 6、真实之声以及日本的The Gospellers。这种音乐风格的小组近年也流行于香港，台湾和日本。A cappella (Italian for "in the manner of the church" or "in the manner of the chapel",also see gospel music and choir) music is specifically solo or group singing without instrumental sound, or a piece intended to be performed in this way. It contrasts with cantata, which is accompanied singing. A cappella was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.
