在2011年早期，后回响贝斯（Post-Dubstep）被用来形容被回响贝斯（Dubstep）影响的当代流行音乐。这些作品借鉴了Dubstep的一些制作手法，比如浑厚的贝斯节拍。以及UK garage、2-step和其他跳舞音乐的特点。此领域的音乐人也会尝试将氛围音乐和2000年后复兴的R&B元素融入其中。另外，Post-Dubstep还有个很鲜明的特点：它的节拍一般在每分钟130拍左右。Mount Kimbie、Fantastic Mr Fox和James Blake等音乐人是此风格的代表音乐人。2010年后兴起的Future Garage、Witch House等风格也常被视为Post-Dubstep运动的分支。In early 2011 the term "post-dubstep" was used to describe urban music that was influenced by certain aspects of dubstep.The breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term post-dubstep preclude it from being a specific musical genre. Pitchfork writer Martin Clark has suggested that "well-meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed. This is not one genre. However, given the links, interaction, and free-flowing ideas ... you can't dismiss all these acts as unrelated"Such music often references earlier dubstep productions as well as UK garage, 2-step and other forms of underground electronic dance music.Artists producing music that has been described as post-dubstep have also incorporated elements of ambient music and early 2000s (decade) R&B. The latter in particular is heavily sampled by three artists described as post-dubstep: Mount Kimbie, Fantastic Mr Fox and James Blake.The tempo of music typically characterised as post-dubstep is approximately 130 beats per minute.The production duo Mount Kimbie is often associated with the origination of the term post-dubstep.The commercially popular band The xx's Jamie xx has released remixes which are considered post-dubstep, including We're New Here (2011), a Gil Scott-Heron remix album.
