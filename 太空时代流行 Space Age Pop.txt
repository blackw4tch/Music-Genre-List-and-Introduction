Space age pop is a general and loosely based term for a music genre associated with certain Mexican and American composers and songwriters in the Space Age of the 1950s and 1960s. It is also called bachelor pad music or lounge music.[1] Space age pop was inspired by the spirit of those times, an optimism based on the strong post-war economy and technology boom, and excitement about humanity's early forays into space.[2][3] Although there is no specific album, date, or year when the genre was born, producer Irwin Chusid identifies its heyday as "roughly 1954 to 1963â€”from the dawn of high-fidelity (hi-fi) to the arrival of the Beatles."[4]The music is not limited to a single style, and it is not always easily categorized. There are several styles that can be recognized as an influence: classical composers like Ravel and Debussy; the big bands of the 1940s; and different exotic styles, such as samba, latin, and calypso jazz. Space Age pop is related to the genres of lounge music, exotica, or beautiful music,[2] and may be regarded as a precursor to the musical genre of space music.
