It is played at a relatively slow tempo and is primarily focused on the intense, intimate lead vocal delivery, emphasizing both the melancholic tone and lyrics, and producing a downbeat, reflective atmosphere. Common instrumental tropes include murky, 'scratchy' guitar sounds, prominent horn sections (accompanying strings more popular in 1970s recordings) and crystalline, spiritual-sounding piano and organ parts. The style declined in popularity in the late 1970s with the emergence of Disco and newer R&B genres. Notable artists include James Carr, Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, O.V. Wright, Aretha Franklin, Lee Moses and Irma Thomas. Due to sharing similar influences, southern soul backing and often moods and lyrical fare, some deep soul artists forayed into Country Soul.(By Rateyourmusic)
