New jack swing是一种R&B和Hip-Hop融合的曲风，从80年代晚期到90年代早期和中期开始流行。这种曲风融合了非典型Hip-Hop中的"Swing"节拍(这种节拍源自于大量的运用有节奏的即兴创作)和当代R&B的演唱风格，在Hip-Hop黄金年代非常流行。New Jack Swing evolved in the late '80s, when urban contemporary soul artists began incorporating hip-hop rhythms, samples, and production techniques into their sound. Some songs simply had hip-hop beats, others had rapped sections and sung choruses, but the overall result was an edgier, more street-oriented sound that seamlessly blended both the melodic qualities of soul and the funky rhythms of rap. It paved the way for the '90s soul, where the dividing line between rap and R&B was frequently indistinguishable.
