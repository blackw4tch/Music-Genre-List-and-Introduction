喜剧摇滚是在摇滚中被设计成取笑传统和主流社会的摇滚音乐。在曲调和歌词上的抨击使它显得很幽默。有时喜剧摇滚是不成熟的---这种风格的教父: Frank Zappa, 喜欢对废物排放问题和傻瓜开玩笑——但是它最好的一面是：它很聪明的将陈词滥调与传统串联在一起。在摇滚音乐中的喜剧摇滚，从主流中冲出,在中国国内的摇滚大地上独树一帜，调侃的曲风，诙谐的词语，细腻的制作，形成了自己的氛围与线路。把民间曲艺与摇滚音乐相结合是中国喜剧摇滚的特点，也是有别与世界各地其他喜剧摇滚，而更具有内涵的新音乐。Comedy Rock is roughly defined as a mix of Rock or any of its sub-genres with elements of Comedy such as Satire and Musical Parody, as well as concepts of Novelty music. Frank Zappa, known for his regular usage of satirical references to certain aspects and trends of popular culture, is considered as one of the progenitors of the genre. While the style has developed a mostly cult following during its existence, some artists have achieved a moderate or sometimes even high level of mainstream popularity, including The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Flight of the Conchords, The Dead Milkmen, Tenacious D and Spinal Tap.
