交响乐（SYMPHONY）又称交响曲。是采用大型管弦乐队演奏的鸣奏曲（奏鸣—交响套曲）。交响音乐主要是指交响曲、协奏曲、乐队组曲、序曲和交响诗五种体裁。但其范畴也时常扩展到一些各具特色的管弦乐曲，如交响乐队演奏的幻想曲、随想曲、狂想曲、叙事曲、进行曲、变奏曲和舞曲等。此外，交响音乐还包括标题管弦乐曲。The symphony is one of the central forms of Classical music and one that has something new to say to each generation. Typically, a symphony is a multi-movement, multi-character work for orchestra, with origins in the sinfonias that served as curtain-raisers for operas in the early 17th century. In the Classical era, Haydn perfected the form, which would bring forth masterpieces from Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Sibelius, Shostakovich, Ives, and so many others. As it developed, symphonies began to encompass more than abstract musical ideas, embracing programmatic narratives, nationalistic characteristics, and modern compositional techniques such as serialism. Even in the 21st century, when the costs -- financial and otherwise -- of performing such large-scale works can seem prohibitive, composers like Einojuhani Rautavaara, Philip Glass, and Tan Dun are still compelled to write them.
