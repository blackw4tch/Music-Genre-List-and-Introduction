基督教说唱就是在 Hip-Hop 节奏上唱出颂赞歌词。起初，Hip-Hop 的都市生活和暴力的主题与现代基督教音乐的和平与轻松似乎无缘。然而，DC Talk, T-Bone 和 Transformation Crusade 发现这两者的混合体是有观众的。MC Hammer 是第一个以明确的基督主题获得成功的说唱乐者；在 20 世纪 90 年代早期，他创作的热门单曲“Pray”把至今仍在萌芽期的基督教说唱介绍给他的广大听众。 Christian hip hop (originally Gospel rap, also known as Christian rap, Gospel hip hop, holy hip hop, or Christ hop) is a form of hip hop music that uses Christian themes to express the songwriter's faith. Only during the 1990s did this term "Christian hip hop" become descriptive of this type of music. While the audience is typically Christian, the music is also used in (Christian) missions work for the purpose of evangelization. Christian rap and hip hop artists are often professed Christians who often use their background to express their beliefs.
