主流爵士其实是爵士乐的一位评论家斯坦利．丹斯创造的，他在描述五十年代的小号演奏家巴克．克莱顿和他同期音乐家的演奏时首次使用了这个词。这些音乐家大多都是摇摆乐时代的资深音乐家，他们并不是使他们的风格现代化，并不演奏波普爵士乐，或是加入五十年代重新兴起的迪克西兰乐队，从前的大乐队时代的明星们以小乐队的形式演奏昔日的标准曲，并获得巨大的成功。在20世纪50年代斯坦利．丹斯定义了主流爵士之后，定义随着爵士音乐的演变和发展而改变。 那么以前主流的东西现在不会被认为是主流。从一般意义上讲，主流爵士乐可以被认为是当时最受欢迎的节目：例如，在摇摆乐时代 ，摇摆乐和大乐队音乐处于巅峰期，目标则是受众正在关注的音乐类型。 虽然Bebop在那段时间被引入爵士乐，但那时候的观众并没有对它有所了解。Mainstream jazz is a term that was first established in the 1950s by music journalist Stanley Dance. At that time, Dance considered "Mainstream" anything within the popular jazz music of the Swing Era.[1] Another way to describe Mainstream Jazz in the 1950s was music that did not incorporate the bebop style.After Dance defined Mainstream Jazz in the 1950s, the definition changed with the evolution and progression of jazz music. What was mainstream then would not be considered mainstream now. In a general sense, Mainstream Jazz can be considered what was most popular at the time: For example, during the Swing era, swing and big band music were in their prime and what target audiences were looking for. Although Bebop was introduced into jazz during that time, audiences had not developed an ear for it.
