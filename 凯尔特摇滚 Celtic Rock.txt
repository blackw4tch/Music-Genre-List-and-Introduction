凯尔特摇滚（Celtic Rock），从朋克管弦乐队如the Pogues到纽约/凯尔特的混合物如Black 47到轻微的改变爱尔兰曲调Cranberries，Celtic这些摇滚乐队通过摇滚的韵律结合了爱尔兰演奏乐器来创作音乐，那是狂热与激情，忧郁和浪漫共存的风格。凯尔特摇滚经常展现出明显的爱尔兰酒吧音乐的特征，但是它也同时描绘了与R&B和另类摇滚并列的流行音乐。Celtic rock is a genre of folk rock and a form of Celtic fusion which incorporates Celtic music, instrumentation and themes into a rock music context. It has been extremely prolific since the early 1970s and can be seen as a key foundation of the development of highly successful mainstream Celtic bands and popular musical performers, as well as creating important derivatives through further fusions. It has played a major role in the maintenance and definition of regional and national identities and in fostering a pan-Celtic culture. It has also helped to communicate those cultures to external audiences.
