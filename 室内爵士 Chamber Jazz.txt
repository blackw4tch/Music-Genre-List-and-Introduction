室内爵士是爵士乐流派的一种，深受新古典主义音乐与西洋音乐的古典形态影响，在有些国家也是受到传统凯尔特音乐，欧洲民间音乐，拉美音乐的影响而成型。Chamber Jazz is distinguished by small, acoustic-based ensembles in which improvisation is a major factor. Though some groups are more jazz-based than others, they all tend to employ neoclassical aesthetics, particularly from the Impressionistic period and later 20th-century movements. Ethnic elements are also an important factor. These world-music leanings, however, are usually oriented toward the classical traditions of other cultures (Indian, Middle Eastern, and Asian), although South American styles also figure prominently in a lot of these recordings. -- Linda Kohanov
