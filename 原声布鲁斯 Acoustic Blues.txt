原声布鲁斯（Acoustic Blues）是布鲁斯音乐中很宽泛的一个派别。 所有用原声乐器弹奏的布鲁斯音乐都可包含在内。特征原声布鲁斯中的“原声”不仅仅指的吉他，其乐器也可以是钢琴、曼陀林、口琴、班卓琴等其他一切非电声乐器。所以原声布鲁斯中存在很多风格的影子，比如民谣、传统乐、滑棒、指弹、拉格泰姆等等。流行时段1920年代初发源英文简介Acoustic Blues is a general catch-all term describing virtually every type of blues that can be played on a non-electric musical instrument. It embraces a wide range of guitar and musical styles including folk, the songster tradition, slide, fingerpicking, ragtime, and all of the myriad regional strains (Chicago, Delta, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Piedmont, etc.) that thrived in the early days of the genre's gestation. But acoustic blues is not limited to merely guitar music; its "acoustic" appellation is an elastic enough term to also include mandolin, banjo, piano, harmonica, jug, and other non-electric instruments including homemade ones, like the one string monochord bottleneck diddleybow.(By Allmusic)
