石人金属是金属音乐的一个子类，它结合了厄运金属元素与迷幻摇滚和蓝调摇滚元素，创造出沉重却又富含旋律的段落。石人金属跟石人摇滚近似，吉他riff都有着律动感和迷幻感，音乐整体的节奏相对中速偏慢。Stoner metal 乐队校正了 Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Blue Oyster Cult, 以及 Hawkwind 这类乐队中冗长而致幻的即兴表演，那些带有致幻剂色彩的金属和酸性摇滚成分被过滤成早期流行分支的 grunge 风格的那种嗡嗡声。Stoner metal 可以是装模作样而有自知之明的，能够唤起污秽与零乱的，甚或是一种泰然自若的对以往的回顾。无论如何，像 Monster Magnet 和 Kyuss 那样的乐队，完美地契合了90年代早期另类金属运动的电子乐口味。即使是在 grunge 风格已经褪色，而工业和 hip-hop 的影响也开始加诸于另类金属的时候，stoner metal 依然是进入新世纪以来深受推崇的一种风格。Stoner metal is a subgenre of metal music that combines elements of doom metal with elements of psychedelic rock and blues rock to create a melodic yet heavy sound. Like stoner metal's close relative genre stoner rock, riffs are often groovy and psychedelic, while the tempo of the music as a whole is generally slow to mid paced. The guitar tuning is kept low and, unlike stoner rock, there is an additional emphasis on a bass-heavy sound. This form of music was first pioneered in the early 1990s by such bands as Kyuss, Sleep, and Cathedral.Several of the genre's earliest establishers shared a common characteristic in that both band members and fans alike were frequent marijuana users. This fixation on cannabis, which can also be found within the lyrics of many songs, when combined with the heavy and psychedelic sound of the music gave the genre its now defining nickname as stoner metal. Due to the similarities in styles, some stoner metal bands will borrow and incorporate certain aspects of sludge and vice versa.
