早在六十年代，实验性大乐队开始融入自由爵士乐和即兴创作的元素，并在较小的先锋乐团和古典作曲家的作品的推动下，在接下来的几十年中扩大了他们的范围，尝试无固定调性的音乐，不和谐和日益复杂结构。从像Sun Ra Arkestra和Carla Bley这样的大乐队这样的团体开始，到Little Huey创作音乐管弦乐队的全面混乱，实验大乐队在大型团体编制中产生了惊人的多样化声音。Experimental big bands began to incorporate elements of free jazz and improvisation as early as the '60s, and fueled by the work of smaller avant-garde ensembles and classical composers, increased their scope in the following decades to embrace atonal music, discordance and increasingly complex structures. From the post-bop beginnings of groups like the Sun Ra Arkestra and Carla Bley's big band, to the full-on chaos of the Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra, experimental big bands produce an amazing diversity of sounds within the large group format.
