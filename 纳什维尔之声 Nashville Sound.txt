纳什维尔之声是1950年代乡村音乐的别称，主要盛行于田纳西州的纳什维尔。从音乐风格上看，它介于乡村音乐和流行音乐之间，既具有乡村音乐的乡土特色，同时也带有流行音乐的时代气息。具体来看，纳什维尔之声主要以钢琴、弦乐和背景合音来作为音乐基础，它与传统的提琴、班卓琴伴奏的乡村音乐有所不同，比传统乡村音乐显得更加流行化，更具盛业气息。Countrypolitan — an outgrowth of the Nashville sound of the '50s — is among the most commercially-oriented genres of country music. The Nashville sound emerged in the '50s as a way to bring country music to a broad pop audience. The movement was led by Chet Atkins, who was the head of RCA Records' country division. Atkins designed a smooth, commercial sound that relied on country song structures but abandoned all of the hillbilly and honky tonk instrumentation. He hired session musicians and coordinated pop-oriented, jazz-tinged productions. Similarly, Owen Bradley created productions — most notably with Patsy Cline — that featured sophisticated productions and smooth, textured instrumentation. Eventually, most records from Nashville featured this style of production and the Nashville sound began to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. In the late '60s, the Nashville sound metamorphosed into countrypolitan, which emphasized these kinds of pop production flourishes. Featuring layers of keyboards, guitars, strings, and vocals, countrypolitan records were designed to cross over to pop radio and they frequently did. The sound dominated the country charts in the '70s and stayed popular until the early '80s.
