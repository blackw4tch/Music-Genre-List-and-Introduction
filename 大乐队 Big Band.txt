又译大乐队或大乐队时代，是演奏爵士乐的乐团，流行于美国30年代初到50年代末的摇摆年代(Swing Era)。大乐团的编制通常有10到25位乐手，包括演奏萨克斯风、小喇叭、伸缩喇叭、铁琴的乐手，还有歌手以及负责节奏乐器的乐手。20年代末期出现的新型大乐队有更多即兴的成分。但这类型的爵士乐不若为跳舞而演奏的爵士乐来得受欢迎，期间只有少数音乐被录制成唱片，所制成的唱片被称为‘民族唱片’(Race records)，听众也只限于少数的都市人口，且只有极少数的白人乐手熟悉这类曲风。这类曲风主要在纽约市、芝加哥、堪萨斯市发展。A Big Band is a type of musical ensemble that usually consists of ten or more musicians with four sections: saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular. The term "big band" is also used to describe a genre of music. One problem with this usage is that it overlooks the variety of music played by these bands.Big bands started as accompaniment for dancing. In contrast with the emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.The Big Band genre at JMA is for large ensembles (generally ten or more musicians) who play in what best can be called a "big band style". The big band style involves breaking the large ensemble into separate sections, usually grouped by instrument, that then engage in call and response type figures with each other. These motifs can be arranged or improvised. The big band arranging style can also use repeating interlocking riffs by the various sections that provide a rhythmic groove for soloists. Early innovators in big band music include Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Benny Goodman. Modern big band leaders include Quincy Jones and Maynard Ferguson.The Big Band genre at JMA also includes jazz influenced pop orchetra leaders such as Paul Whiteman, Glen Miller and the Dorsey Brothers. Modern big bands that are influenced by avant-garde music, 3rd stream music or other types of modern elements can be found in the Progressive Big Band genre.
