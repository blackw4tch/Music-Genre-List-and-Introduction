原型朋克出现于60年代末期，以其沙哑的、基本无旋律的音乐著称，简单流转的吉他重复段，霸气的音乐风格，和演唱者地道的英格兰口音（这其中不包括另类音乐代表David Bowie和Roxy Music）都激发了未来朋克音乐的进一步兴盛。出现于1969年左右的the MC5和the Stooges以其沙哑的、基本无旋律的音乐著称，他们比其他乐队更明晰地阐述了朋克音乐风格。70年代初，the New York Dolls浮出水面，以其直白的硬摇滚音乐和迷人的形象揭开了美国纽约朋克音乐的幕角；同时，也有另一些小范围的准朋克音乐流行开来，如Patti Smith, RICHARD HELL，和Televisions Tom Verlaine。许多被认为是原型朋克的英格兰音乐人也成为迷惑摇滚的一部分，他们简单流转的吉他重复段，霸气的音乐风格，和演唱者地道的英格兰口音（这其中不包括另类音乐代表David Bowie和Roxy Music）都激发了未来朋克音乐的进一步兴盛。Proto-punk is a term used retrospectively to describe a number of musicians who were important precursors of punk rock in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s, or who have been cited by early punk musicians as influential. Typically, these artists were not themselves considered punk; furthermore, the typification is not widely regarded to have been the result of a distinct musical genre as these precursors came from a wide array of backgrounds, styles, and influences.American acts like Death, The Seeds, Paul Revere & the Raiders, The Monks, The Sonics, Shadows of Knight, The Velvet Underground, The Doors, The Trashmen, MC5, The Stooges, Suicide, The Modern Lovers, New York Dolls, The Dictators, Lou Reed, Big Star, The Fugs, Television, Captain Beefheart, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, Rocket from the Tombs, and Love, German acts such as Ton Steine Scherben, Neu! and Can, Australian band Radio Birdman, and acts from the United Kingdom including The Kinks, The Troggs, The Who, David Bowie, T. Rex, Faces, Mott The Hoople, Roxy Music, Peter Hammill's Nadir's Big Chance, Doctors of Madness and Hawkwind are commonly cited as the most noteworthy artists that would ultimately influence punk.
