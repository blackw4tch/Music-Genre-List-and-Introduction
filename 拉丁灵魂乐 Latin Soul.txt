Latin soul was a short lived musical genre movement which developed in the 1960s in New York City. It consisted of a blend of Cuban mambo with elements of Latin jazz and soul music.Although short-lived, the genre had a great influence on the growing Salsa movement which would dominate the New York Latin music scene in the 1970s. Today, the term is typically used by Hispanic artists producing R&B or soul music.Latin soul placed a heavy emphasis on its Afro-Cuban rhythms and featured songs sung mostly in English. The style grew out of an attempt on the part of Latin musicians in New York City to expand the reach of their music beyond the local Latin community and into the wider mainstream American society.
