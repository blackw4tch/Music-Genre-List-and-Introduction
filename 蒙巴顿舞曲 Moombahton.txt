蒙巴顿舞曲是一种结合了浩室音乐（House）和雷吉顿舞曲（Reggaeton）的新兴舞曲流派，是由美国DJ Dave Nada定义的一种风格，特点是厚实的电气声和慢慢扩散的低音线，；Build up的处理上比较情景化，不像是常规的堆叠式推动情绪，而是放空并切换场景的戏剧式；并且在放慢的Bpm里填充上快而密集的鼓点，并且伴有人声切片样本。Moombahton其实是一种放慢速度的Electro House，并且加入了Reggaeton和Dutch House的元素，有种魔性的节奏律动，充满了拉丁风情。这类风格慢慢受到了各大DJ的青睐，并且随着神曲《Lean On》的出现而火爆全球。Moombahton is a fusion genre of house music and reggaeton that was created by American DJ and producer Dave Nada (born David Villegas) in Washington, D.C., in 2009. Identifying characteristics of moombahton include a thick and spread-out bass line, dramatic builds; and a two-step pulse, with quick drum fills. Occasionally moombahton includes ravey synthesizers and a cappella rap samples. Nada coined the name as a portmanteau of Moombah (a track by Dutch house DJ Chuckie and producer/DJ Silvio Ecomo), and reggaeton (itself a neologism combining reggae with the Spanish suffix -ton, signifying big).
