前卫的爵士乐（也称为前卫爵士乐）是一种音乐和即兴创作风格，将前卫的艺术音乐与爵士乐融为一体。它起源于20世纪50年代，并发展到20世纪60年代。最初是自由爵士乐的代名词，但是非常前卫的爵士乐与这种风格截然不同。先锋爵士乐可以是非常自由的，因为音乐家不用遵循某个规定好的结构，先锋爵士可能是极其嘈杂的，也可能是极其安静的。Avant-Garde最先被用在Free-Jazz运动刚爆炸的时候；拿来形容Ornette Coleman这些乐手；德布希的改变钢琴史的作法也被视为Avant-Garde，当然；实验性质强烈的剧场音乐更具有Avant-Garde Jazz的风格。Avant-garde jazz (also known as avant-jazz) is a style of music and improvisation that combines avant-garde art music and composition with jazz. It originated in the 1950s and developed through the 1960s. Originally synonymous with free jazz, much avant-garde jazz was distinct from that style.The Avant-garde Jazz genre at JMA generally consists of jazz that is usually atonal, and quite often a-rhythmic as well. Avant-garde jazz can be ‘free’, in that there is no prescribed structure for the musicians to follow, or there may be some sort of compositional structure being used as well. Other factors that can result in an avant-garde tag include the use of extremes, such as extremely loud music, or extremely quiet music etc. Also, experimental presentations can be considered, such as a piece where the performers are playing without being able to hear each other, or all of the musicians are submerged in water, etc. Generally the Avant-garde Jazz genre is reserved for musicians from a jazz background, but JMA also includes some non-jazz avant-garde musicians in our Jazz Related Improvisation/Composition genre.
