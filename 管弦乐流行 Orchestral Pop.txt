管弦乐是随着16，17世纪声乐与器乐的发展逐渐形成的，到了18世后，海顿确立了管弦乐队编制和主调音乐样式；莫扎特则进一步加以肯定，贝多芬以交响性、戏剧性手法写作管弦乐序曲。19世纪到20世纪管弦乐发展达到鼎盛时期，一大批优秀作曲家与优秀作品相继出现。Easy Listening music is instrumental music that was designed to be soothing and relaxing. Unlike jazz, which demands your utmost attention, easy listening slips into the background, which is the very reason many critics and listeners dismissed the music as nothing more than disposible fluff. Although some records certainly fall into that category, there were a number of inventive arrangers and conductors working in the genre, such as Martin Denny, Les Baxter and Esquivel, who distinguished themselves with unpredictable instrumentation and idiosyncratic arrangements. Still, the primary characteristic of easy listening, from Ray Conniff's lush wordless vocals to the Latin flourishes of Herb Alpert, is that it's pleasant and easy on the ears.
