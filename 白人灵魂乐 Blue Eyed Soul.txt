白人灵魂乐（Blue Eyed Soul）顾名思义，就是白人演绎的灵魂乐。灵魂乐一直以来是黑人音乐，但是到了1960年代中期，一些白人音乐人如the Righteous Brothers开始尝试灵魂乐，并在榜单上有很好的表现，这也让Blue Eyed Soul开始发展。英文简介Blue-Eyed Soul refers to soul and R&B music performed and sung by white musicians. The term first came into play during the mid-'60s, when acts like the Righteous Brothers had hits with soulful songs like "You Lost That Loving Feeling." Throughout the late '60s, blue-eyed soul thrived, as acts like the Rascals, the Box Tops, Mitch Ryder, Tony Joe White, and Roy Head had a series of hits. During the '70s, blue-eyed soul continued to be successful, as acts like Hall & Oates, Robert Palmer, Average White Band, Boz Scaggs, and David Bowie updated the formula.
