中西部说唱是指那些由来自美国中西部地区的艺人演唱的一种说唱音乐风格。与之相对应的是美国的东、西、南部说唱风格。这种风格在九十年代中期开始进入主流视野，例如Bone Thugs-n-Harmony（克利夫兰）、Twista（芝加哥）、Tech N9ne（堪萨斯城）、Atmosphere（明尼阿波利斯）、Eminem（底特律）和Big Sean（底特律）。和东、西、南部说唱具有明显的地域风格不同，定义一个“典型”的中西部说唱可能是非常困难的。Midwest hip hop is hip hop music performed by artists from the Midwestern United States. In contrast with its East Coast, West Coast and Southern counterparts, Midwest hip hop has very few constants. Its first dose of national popularity came in the mid-90s with the extremely fast-paced styles of rappers known as Choppers, such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (Cleveland), Twista (Chicago), Tech N9ne (Kansas City, Missouri), Atmosphere (Minneapolis, Minnesota), Freddie Gibbs (Gary, Indiana), and Eminem/Slim Shady (Detroit, Michigan).However, while the artists mentioned above became the first to introduce Midwest hip hop that rivaled the popularity of West and East Coast styles, subsequent acts have since risen to national prominence such as Nelly, D12, Common and Kanye West but they share very few similarities. It is because these lack of constants between acts from different cities (and sometimes even between artists from the same city) that it can be extremely difficult to define a "typical" Midwest sound. One characteristic of Midwest hip hop is that beat tempos can range from 90 to about 180, while East Coast's beat tempo is 90–120, West Coast is 100–120, and Southern rap is 80–180.
