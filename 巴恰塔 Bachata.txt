A form of romantic dance music that originated in the Dominican Republic, but is now popular elsewhere in Latin America, as well as among Latinos in the U.S. Standardly features arpeggiated chords in the melody, and the instrumentation usually consists of an effects (flanger, reverb, and/or echo) laden lead guitar, a syncopated rhythm guitar, and electric bass, g√ºira, and bongos keeping the rhythm. Lyrics often dwell on pain, trouble, and the dark side of love, and some compare Bachata to the blues for this reason.
