弗拉门戈（Flamenco），是一种源于西班牙南部安达卢西亚地区的艺术形式，包括歌曲、音乐和舞蹈。弗拉门戈的形成深受安达卢西亚地区的摩尔人和犹太人的影响，还吸收了大量罗姆人（吉普赛人）的艺术元素。当代著名的弗拉门戈舞蹈家大多是罗姆人。由于西班牙政府以此推动旅游业，弗拉门戈舞已经成了西班牙舞蹈甚至西班牙文化的代表。弗拉门戈音乐有50种，每种有自己的节奏模式。弗拉门戈舞蹈是一种即兴舞蹈，没有固定的动作，全靠舞者和演唱、伴奏的人以及观众之间的情绪互动。Flamenco (Spanish pronunciation: [flaˈmeŋko]) is a form of Spanish folk music and dance from the region of Andalusia in southern Spain. It includes cante (singing), toque (guitar playing), baile (dance) and palmas (handclaps). First mentioned in literature in 1774, the genre grew out of Andalusian and Romani music and dance styles.Flamenco is often associated with the Romani people of Spain (Gitanos) and a number of famous flamenco artists are of this ethnicity. While flamenco originally crystalized among gypsies in the 18th century,some authors believe that modern flamenco mostly emerged out of late nineteenth-century romanticism.In recent years flamenco has become popular all over the world and is taught in many countries: in Japan there are more academies than there are in Spain. On November 16, 2010 UNESCO declared flamenco one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
